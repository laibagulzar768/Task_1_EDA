# Airbnb Listings – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Welcome to my Data Science Internship Project – Task 1!

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a real-world dataset of Airbnb listings. The dataset used contains details such as listing names, prices, host information, and more, mainly focused on New York City.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: Airbnb Open Data
- **File Used**: Dataset

## 📊 Task Overview

**Task 1: EDA and Visualization**

### ✅ Steps Followed:

1. **Load the Dataset**  
   - Used `pandas` to load and explore the structure of the data.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values using imputation/removal.
   - Removed duplicates.
   - Detected and managed outliers using visual and statistical methods.

3. **Data Visualization**  
   - Bar charts for categorical columns like `neighbourhood group`, `room type`, etc.
   - Histograms for numeric distributions such as `price`, `availability_365`, etc.
   - Correlation heatmap for numeric features.

4. **Insights & Observations**  
   - Documented key trends, outliers, and data quality concerns.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- **Brooklyn** and **Manhattan** have the highest number of listings.
- Most listings are private rooms.
- Some extreme outliers in pricing skew the distribution.
- Several listings are inactive (zero availability or reviews).
